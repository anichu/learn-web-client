					<p className="mt-3 text-xl">
						This is another common question that people have about online
						courses. There are usually self-paced programs and traditional
						classroom or meeting-style programs available. Today’s world is full
						of busy people that want to better themselves, so the self-paced
						programs are popular. Whether or not you provide this option, be
						sure to answer this question for people and explain the pros and
						cons of each type of learning. As a bonus, you can even invite them
						to contact you for more information or to discuss what their options

						2.Does online learning really work?
					</h1>
					<p className="mt-3 text-xl">
						There’s always a skeptic, and when it comes to online learning,
						there are often several of them. Everyone wants to know if online
						courses “really work”—and that’s a hard question to answer because
						there are several factors to consider. On a general basis, yes,
						online learning can be effective. However, that depends on whether
						the courses are set up properly, the provider is educated and
						experienced, and if the person taking the courses does well in a
						virtual learning environment. You should be able to explain these
						things to people so that they know what they’re getting into. Then,
						you can invite them to contact you to discuss whether it would be
						right for them.

						3.Why should I use online learning?
					</h1>
					<p className="mt-3 text-xl">
						Here’s an example of the use of “why” instead of offering a yes/no
						question. People will wonder what online learning can do for them
						and rather than telling them whether or not they can benefit, you’re
						explaining how everyone can benefit from online learning when they
						do it properly. Explain the benefits of learning online, from
						convenience and flexibility to the ability to learn at their own
						pace, and so forth. Make sure that you are very clear that it’s
						about what people can gain from online learning and that you don’t
						even suggest that they may not benefit here. Provide testimonials,
						perks, and other insight to help people decide that your online
						courses are right for their needs. Online learning benefits just
						about everyone. You can even go the extra mile and list some stats
						about the success rates and benefits of online courses to reaffirm
						your stance.
